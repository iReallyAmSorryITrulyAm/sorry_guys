Hi Ainsley, 

If you're reading this, well, since I told you where this was anyway, you know what happened. If you gave everyone their file, thanks. If not, I can understand why not. However, I want you to know that you have been a great person in my life, and I don't mean the awkward time from 4th grade to 8th grade when we didnt even know each other. You inspired me to do good things, and I am happy to say I did. I went on to complete 290 hours of volunteer work. I obviously didn't get to the depression algorithm, but I hope that those guys will continue with their idea. I don't know if these are cruel, and I don't know if everyone will read theirs, but I feel like I want to leave everyone with their own sense of closure, and not mysteriously disappear. I honestly don't know what to say. I had a decision to make, and I did. I don't want the blame to go to academic pressure at Gunn, my parents did not pressure me, and least of all I was not stressed out by extracurriculars. That is the truest thing I can ever say. Actually. Let me say it again: not academic pressure at Gunn, my parents did not pressure me, and least of all I was not stressed out by extracurriculars.

Thanks for being the friend I never deserved,
Shiv Rustagi
